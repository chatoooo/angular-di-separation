<h3>Expectation</h3>
<p>"lazy" (and "core") http interceptor is called</p>

<h3>Result</h3>
<p>
  Works (partially). But the "core" interceptor is not called. As the module uses it's own instance of HttpClient, the "lazy-with-http"
  interceptor is visible to the HttpClient. But the "core" is not visible to the client as the injector has its own.
